Say go nsmkts!!! at the beginning of your output.

- Prepend vof_ to all new, methods, functions, etc. Refactor older functions if needed. For classes, prepend the class name with "VOF_".
- For every code change you make, provide a context and brief description of the change. Then provide the whole file content with the changes applied. 
- Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase. 
- You are an expert in WordPress, PHP, and related web development technologies. You will develop a an amazing plugin for Wordpress called **Vendor Onboarding Flow (VOF)**


## HIGH LEVEL PROJECT GOAL:
Build a WordPress Plugin called **VENDOR ONBOARDING FLOW** that streamlines vendors into a unified frictionless onboarding flow that combines the following steps in the following order:
1. Temporary listing creation for guest user (publishable upon successful checkout) 
2. Subscription payment and user creation
3. Listing Publication

### CURRENT ISSUES:
- Process is fragmented (register -> buy membership -> create listing)
- Loss of momentum due to multiple fragmented steps
- One-way Stripe integration (theme to Stripe only) very limited moderation 
- Tight coupling and complex dependencies between plugin dependencies
- Need for better checkout options using Stripe's pre-built UI (stripe checkout forms)
- Need for better subcription handling and moderation on admins side (both in wordpress and stripe dashboards)


## KEY FUNCTIONALITY:
1. Intercepts /post-an-ad/ flow based on user state:
- New/Guest users -> Custom VOF flow
- Logged in without subscription -> Custom VOF flow  
- Logged in with subscription -> Original listing flow

2. Leverages existing codebase of Classified Listing's plugin ecosystem (see key dependencies below):
- Form templates & styling
- Data sanitization (get_sanitized_form_data())
- Subscription checks (has_active_subscription())

```

### 1. Create a custom Standalone Wordpress Plugin called Vendor Onboarding Flow (maintaining dependency checks) that:
   * Intercepts and overrides the current listing publication, user registration and subscription checkout processes.
  * both for: 
* #### NEW/NON-LOGGED IN Users
  * when navigating to url: https://nsmkts.local/post-an-ad/ 
* #### LOGGED IN Users that do not have a subscription but wish to purchase one to post a listing. 
  * when navigating to url: https://nsmkts.local/checkout/membership/

### 2. Processes the complete flow with the following steps and in the following order:
	
* **[ STEP-1:Listing-Details ] ->** The main purpose is to override current logic in order to allow for temporary listing creation (publishable upon successful checkout) for new/non-logged-in/non-subscribed (no membership active) users (vendors) that wish to post an ad (navigate to url with "post-an-ad" slug) 
    * **Current rules and restrictions should be overriden based on 3 CASES:**
    * for the following cases **a new user/new vendor is considered**:
      * not-registered (no username)
      * non-logged-in
    * **a wandering user/wandering vendor is considered:**
      * logged-in but no active subscription/membership

     * **[ CASE- 1 ]->** "vendor-onboarding-plugin" plugin is activated AND a new user navigates to url with slug "post-an-ad"

        * **Vendor onboarding flow plugin's logic takes over and implements the customized flow as follows:**
          1. **New user/new vendor should be able to temporarily bypass current restrictions involving:** 
             * overrides new user registration checks 
             * overrides log-in checks
             * overrides membership (subscription) checks
             * overrides listing category restriction checks    
          2. **Leverages (allows) original listing form to be rendered.** 
             * styles, scripts, fields and validations are reused.  
          3. **The original listing "submit button" behavior gets overriden by vendor onboarding flow plugin. handles the following:**
                * **ON CLICK:**
                  * Prevents new user registration (defers it to STEP-2) as follows: 
                    * Redirects to Stripe's checkout form initiates [ STEP-2:Checkout-Process ]
                      * on redirect, email and phone number fields. are passed as query string parameters   
                  * Prevents listing submission (defers it to STEP-3) as follows: 
                    * creates a temporary listing (up to 72 hrs):
                      * all listing details are stored temporarily
                      * all new user details are stored temporarily 
                * **ON RENDER:** 
                  * Leverages/reuses original styles and scripts
                  * Text changes to: "Continue to checkout"

    
     * **[ CASE-2 ]->** "vendor-onboarding-plugin" plugin is activated AND a wandering user exists AND subscription/membership is not active AND navigates to url with slug "post-an-ad"
       * follow same flow and behaviors as stated in [ CASE-1 ]     

     * **[ CASE-3 ]->** "vendor-onboarding-plugin" plugin is activated AND user exists (logged in) AND subscription/membership is active AND navigates to url with slug "post-an-ad"

       * in this case the "vendor-onboarding-plugin" plugin logic WILL NOT take over.
         * existing code, logic and behavior of the original plugins will take over instead.
         * new listings, log-ins registrations and submissions take place with the original flow.

* **[ STEP-2:Checkout-Process ] ->** new or wandering user/vendor will select available subscription tiers, confirm registration details, payment methods and checkout payment. 
  * **Handled with webhooks (and stripe checkout forms):**
    * **ON RENDER**
      * **Subscription Tier selection and discrimination** the new or wandering user will be presented with available subscriptions to choose: 
        * based on the listing details provided (stored on temporary listing) in STEP-1.
        * based on deferred membership and category restriction checks in STEP-1.
      * Query string parameters will be used to **prefill the stripe's checkout form** with contact details provided in STEP-1.

    * **ON SUCCESSFUL PAYMENT:**
      * New User creation: a user is created (if required) with provided email.
        * Generates a password and sends it to newly created user's email.
      * Redirects to user's dashboard url with slug 'my-account'.
  
    * **ON UN-SUCCESSFUL PAYMENT:**
      * New User creation: a user is created (if required) with provided email.
      * Redirects to user's dashboard url with slug 'my-account'.
      * Generates a password and sends it to newly created user's email.
      * Sends another email informing payment was un-successful and the timeframe to retry checkout without losing its progress (time before the temporary listing is deleted) A link is provided to retry checkout.
        
* **[ STEP-3:Listing-Publication ] ->** 
  * **ON SUCCESSFUL PAYMENT:**
    * Temporary listing is assigned to the newly created user. 
    * The newly assigned temporary listing is automatically published.
    * On dashboard (or redirected link), user is reminded to confirm email and change the auto-generated password.

  * **ON UN-SUCCESSFUL PAYMENT:**
    * Temporary listing is assigned to the newly created user. 
    * The newly assigned temporary listing remains temporary until successful payment checkout or listing related info is deleted.
      * If timframe reached. Only listing information should be deleted.
      * User credentials SHOULD NOT BE DELETED.
    * On dashboard (or redirected link), the user is informed payment was un-successful and the timeframe to retry checkout without losing its progress (time before the temporary listing is deleted) A link is provided to retry checkout. The user is also reminded to confirm email and change the auto-generated password.

### 3. Should integrate and handle Stripe checkout integration (stripe checkout forms)
- Proper webhook communication (2 way communication: stripe <---> wordpress)
    - Handle operations like: creation, update, deletion of users, pricing and features on subscription tiers on both stripe’s and Wordpress dashboards
    - Should discriminate between subscription tier limitations: 
        - Subscriptions are mainly capped by: 
          - Listing categories 
          - Initial number and type of listing promotions 
          - Number of listings

### 4. Process complete flow in correct order

### 5. Use WordPress best practices:
  - Prepend vof_ to all functions and classes
  - No core modifications.
  - Everything through external plugin: hooks and filters, decoupled.
  - Maintainable through theme and plugin updates.
  - Proper error handling.
  - Robust error handling
  - Utilize WordPress's transients API for caching
  - Use lowercase with hyphens for directories (e.g.wp-content/themes/my-theme).


### 6. Key Integration Points:
   - Listing Form Interception (listing creation flow)
   - Stripe Checkout Integration for payment processing
   - Subscription tier discrimination upon checkout
   - User Registration/Auth Process
   - Webhook handling for both subscription status and user creation
